# This is a document outlining the changes to make to the site design-wise

Things to do:
- Replace text buttons with images wherever it is necessary
- Make a universal color scheme system in CSS so that colors don't get mixed
- Come up with a color scheme to make the site look less bland than other "modern" and "minimalist" sites
- Make individual video thumbnails look individually identifiable from each other
- Make extra buttons in the three dot menu on thumbnails float on top of everything else
- Make the search bar more stylish and modern (less default html)
- Add buttons on top of search results to skip to sections (channels, videos, playlists, etc)
- Make a custom video player instead of the default HTML video player which has a cool design like a panel of buttons on a spaceship or something similar
- Add a settings button to the custom video player to store all the settings and options such as playlist additions
- Make the list of "topics" on the video hyperlinks to the topic urls. Explicitly define topics as different visually.
- Differentiate different sections of views (comment section, video section) from each other visually using styling.
- Add settings to customize the theme of the site using pre-sets and individual color options and fonts to add variety.
- Use custom art made in inkscape and 3D graphics to make the site look good
- Use fonts from fontflipper and randomize the font for logos and the site in general
- Enable the selection of a custom mouse cursor
- Use marquee tags to make scrollable text/images for fun
- Display the ratio of likes to dislikes on content
- Enable the ability to select a reason for the disliking of a video (clickbait, bad content, disabled comments, etc.)
- Implement 4chan-like greentext capabilities
- Implement a pixel-art editor to make avatars instead of an image upload for the icon
- Highlight links to other places in comments
