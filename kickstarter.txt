Pitch To Kickstarter:

Hi, my name is Samuel Graham, and I am the founder of Astro.

When I was 16 I began to worry about the excessive corporatism and censorship of platforms like youtube,
so I began to learn web development and built my own home-brewed version of youtube over the course of two years.

You can find the site at astro-tv.space and see that it is a fully functional website with:
- Video uploading
- Webcam streaming from the browser
- Streaming from OBS
- Live chats on live streams
- Commenting on videos (with other images and videos)
- Playlists
- A Simple Search Engine

My goal with Astro is to introduce healthy competition with youtube in order to stop the monopolization of these kinds of platforms.

I know that this is a difficult challenge, but I believe that it is possible with the help of people willing to make this sort of change.

The [insert money amount] being raised will be used to cover hosting costs, development costs [hold ramen in hand] and expansion of Astro to a wider audience.

If this is something you believe in, then feel free to donate however much you feel like donating.
